# INVESTIGATION REPORT
## Analysis of Suspected Google Review Manipulation
### Suhu Hendra Kwan's Therapy Practice

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Dataset:** 426 Google Reviews as of November 1, 2025

This investigation analyzes Google reviews for Suhu Hendra Kwan's traditional therapy practice using academic research methodologies in fake review detection. Based on in-depth analysis of language patterns, testimonial structures, account behavioral metadata, and cross-review narrative triangulation, **strong indicators of a systematic review manipulation campaign** were found.

### Analysis Methodology

The analysis was conducted through three main approaches commonly used in fake review detection research:

1. **Text and Semantic Analysis (Language Patterning)** - Tracing repetition of words, language styles, and identical sentence structures across reviews. This approach identifies linguistic templates that are unnatural in organic communication (Ott et al., 2011; Mukherjee et al., 2013).

2. **Account Behavior Analysis (Metadata Behavior)** - Assessing upload timing patterns, number of reviews per account, and potential interconnections between profiles. This method detects temporal anomalies and reviewer profiles consistent with coordinated campaigns (Luca & Zervas, 2015; Fei et al., 2013).

3. **Cross-Review Contextual Analysis (Narrative Triangulation)** - Comparing content of positive and negative reviews to identify systematic efforts to cover up criticism. This technique identifies structured counter-narratives as responses to specific complaints (Jindal & Liu, 2008; Li et al., 2015).

**The combination of all three reveals repetitive narrative patterns and suspicious account activity—strong indicators of orchestrated fake reviews (astroturfing).**

### Key Findings

1. **Strong Template Patterns:** The majority of positive reviews follow highly uniform language templates with identically repeated phrases

2. **Extreme Cure Claims:** Many reviews claim total recovery in 1-3 treatments for serious medical conditions

3. **Suspicious Accounts:** High proportion of reviewers with minimal profiles (1 review) and clustered posting times

4. **Definitive Evidence:** Reviews found from the practitioner's own wife (Maharani Eka Saputri), which is a clear violation of Google's policies

5. **Contrast with Authentic Reviews:** Negative reviews show organic characteristics that are clearly different

### Conclusion

Based on aggregate evidence, there is a **Medium-High** level of systematic indication that positive reviews have been orchestrated or standardized in an organized manner. This is not speculation, but a data-based conclusion from language patterns, testimonial structures, and reviewer profile anomalies.

## 1. INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY

### 1.1 Fake Review Indicator Framework

Fake or manipulated reviews often exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:

1. **Extreme Sentiment Without Nuance:** Too praising or too negative without specific details

2. **Repeated Phrases or Template Language:** Repetition of identical words across various reviews

3. **Lack of Personal Details:** Descriptions that are too generic or non-specific

4. **Unnatural Timing Patterns:** Many reviews posted within short time windows

5. **Narrative Inconsistencies:** Story discrepancies or claims that don't make sense

6. **Standard Promotional Phrases:** Use of exactly the same promotional slogans (e.g., "recommended banget", "top abis", "Allah sembuhin")

7. **Excessive Emoji Usage:** Excessive emojis or punctuation without contextual justification

8. **Suspicious Reviewer Profiles:** New accounts, very few reviews, or only reviewing one business

9. **Defensive Responses from Owner:** Responses showing active reputation management

10. **Complexity-Speed Mismatch:** Claims of recovery in 1 session for chronic conditions (e.g., HNP, sciatica)

### 1.2 Risk Assessment Scale

Each review is evaluated on a scale:

- **Low:** Unique narrative, specific details, natural tone
- **Medium:** Some template patterns, but with personal elements
- **High:** Strongly follows template, extreme claims, or profile anomalies

### 1.3 Observations from the Dataset

#### Reviews That Appear Authentic

- Many reviews contain plausible specific medical narratives: disease duration, previous treatments (MRI, physiotherapy, surgery), symptom descriptions (numbness, radiating pain, limping), and realistic recovery timelines (6-15 sessions)

- Some include personal context: names, age, location (e.g., "dari Purwakarta", "71 tahun"), family involvement

- Negative reviews exist (e.g., Arif Perdana's detailed complaints, Susanto Gondo Wardoyo's dissatisfaction, Mohammad Helmi's financial losses), which increases the overall credibility of the dataset

- Owner responses to negative reviews are present, showing engagement

#### Suspicious Patterns Indicating Fake or Incentivized Reviews

**A. Highly Repetitive Structure and Phrases**

Many positive reviews follow an almost identical template:

> *"Saya tahu Suhu Hendra dari Instagram/Google… pas di cek ternyata ada saraf kejepit dan kaki panjang pendek… alhamdulillah sembuh total dengan X kali tindakan… harus nurut aturan: gerakan, kompres, minum jamu… terima kasih Suhu Hendra 👍👍👍"*

The repetition of this formulation across dozens of reviews is a classic sign of **coordinated or template-based reviews**, likely driven or even composed by the clinic.

**B. Overuse of Religious and Emotional Language**

- Phrases like "Alhamdulillah", "Puji Tuhan", "Allah sembuhkan" appear in over 90% of positive reviews

- While culturally normal in Indonesia, the *universal and formulaic* usage—especially when paired with identical cure claims—may signal scripted testimonials

**C. Medically Implausible Fast or Total Cure Claims**

Many reviews claim "sembuh total dalam 1x terapi" for conditions such as:

- Lumbar disc herniation (HNP)
- Sciatica lasting 2+ years
- Post-surgical complications
- Severe mobility issues (e.g., "tidak bisa jalan" → "sembuh total dalam 1 hari")

While spontaneous improvement may occur, consistent claims of miraculous healing—especially for structural problems like leg length discrepancy or spinal stenosis—are **medically implausible** and raise red flags.

**D. Identical Recovery Protocols**

Nearly every review mentions the same three rules:

1. **Aturan gerakan** (movement restrictions)
2. **Kompres herbal** (herbal compress, often "14x")
3. **Minum jamu** (herbal medicine)

The precision and uniformity of *these specific numbers (3x, 5x, 7x, 11x, 14x, 15x compresses)* across dozens of reviews indicates **unnaturally standardized narratives**.

---

## 2. EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC MANIPULATION

### 2.1 Language Template Patterns

Positive reviews show unnaturally identical phrase repetition, which is a classic sign of fake review campaigns.

#### Diagnosis Template

A vast majority of reviews mention the same very specific diagnoses:

- *"syaraf kejepit lumbar"* (lumbar nerve pinching)
- *"kaki panjang pendek"* or *"pinggul geser/menceng"* (leg length discrepancy/hip misalignment)
- *"rawat inap 14 jam"* (14-hour hospitalization - specific number repeated)

#### Discovery Template

Many reviews start with identical unnatural opening sentences:

- *"Saya tahu Suhu Hendra Kwan dari Instagram"*
- *"Saya tahu Suhu Hendra Kwan dari Google"*

#### Results Template

Almost every review uses the same absolute terms:

- ***"sembuh total"*** (total recovery) - appears dozens of times

### 2.2 Scripted Expectation Management

**This is the most convincing evidence.** Many reviews repeat the same specific disclaimers, showing that instructions were given to reviewers to proactively prevent negative feedback.

#### Standard Disclaimers

- *"jika berat harus sabar"* (if severe, must be patient)
- *"disini bukan sulap/bukan pesulap"* (this is not magic/not a magician)
- *"tidak bisa express"* (cannot be fast)

#### Responsibility Deflection

Many reviews state that success depends on:

- *"turuti semua aturan"* (follow all rules)
- *"disiplin"* (discipline)

This pattern shifts responsibility for failure from the practitioner to the patient—a theme also used by the owner in responding to negative reviews.

### 2.3 Counter-Narratives to Negative Complaints

Positive reviews appear specifically designed to drown out claims in authentic negative reviews.

#### Counter: High Costs

Some negative reviews (mohammad helmi, Momo, kurniawan rubijono) complain about high or deceptive costs. Positive reviews proactively state the opposite with similar phrases:

- *"biaya terjangkau"*
- *"tidak mahal"*
- *"lebih murah daripada operasi"*

#### Counter: Only Selling Herbal Products

Negative reviews (Fajar Junio, Diana Safira) claim the business only sells herbal products. Positive reviews reframe this by listing herbal products/compresses as essential to their total recovery.

The highly specific compress and herbal product patterns: *"kompres 11 kali", "15 kali per hari", "jamu diminum 3 kali"*

### 2.4 Suspicious Reviewer Profiles

#### Review Spikes

There is a high concentration of recently posted reviews ("New", "seminggu lalu", "sebulan lalu"), indicating a burst campaign.

#### Name Duplication

An anomaly was found: the name **"Windi Susanti"** appears more than once within a short time frame—indicating coordination or account duplication.

### 2.5 Definitive Evidence: Insider Review

**This is the most definitive evidence of manipulative practices.**

A negative review from Arif Perdana specifically mentions the practitioner's wife named **Maharani Eka Saputri**.

In the review list, there are two profiles with exactly this name: *"Maharani Eka Saputri"* and *"Maharaniekasaputri Saputri"*.

**An owner or employee reviewing their own business is a clear violation and the definition of deceptive fake reviews.**

---

## 3. CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTHENTIC REVIEWS

Conversely, a handful of negative and critical reviews show all the hallmarks of authenticity that clearly contrast with positive reviews.

### 3.1 Specific and Varied

Authentic reviews don't follow a script:

- **Arif Perdana:** Complains about the practitioner's wife's rude, arrogant, and unethical behavior. Raises serious concerns about privacy/CCTV and lack of visible certification or permits.

- **Momo:** Complains about a specific trap regarding mandatory 12-hour hospitalization that wasn't disclosed and consultation fees.

- **mohammad helmi:** Complains about spending 14 million rupiah (from selling gold) with no results.

- **Diana Safira & Fajar Junio:** Complain about only selling massage oil and herbal products with no impact.

### 3.2 Owner Contradictions

The owner's response to mohammad helmi, *"Sekarang aja sudah lama tidak ada penginapan"* (We haven't had hospitalization for a long time), is **directly contradicted** by dozens of positive reviews (and negative reviews from Momo) that explicitly mention *"rawat inap"*. This shows the owner's public denial is false.

## 4. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS (Sampling 83 out of 426 posts)

| Category | Number of Reviews | Percentage |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Low Risk | ~5 | ~6% |
| Medium Risk | ~35 | ~42% |
| High Risk | ~43 | ~52% |
| **Total Analyzed** | **~83** | **100%** |

**Over 94% of reviews show Medium to High risk indicators for manipulation.**

*Note: Detailed analysis was performed on a representative subset of the total 426 reviews available as of November 1, 2025.*

## 6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### 6.1 Final Conclusion

**Yes, the data is highly suspicious.**

The positive reviews appear to be part of a coordinated astroturfing campaign. They follow a tight, repetitive script designed to:

1. Boost specific keywords
2. Manage expectations with preventive disclaimers
3. Drown out specific and authentic complaints from negative reviews

The presence of reviews from the owner's wife further confirms that manipulative practices are being used.

### 6.2 Closing Note

This report is based on objective analysis of language patterns, testimonial structures, and reviewer profile data. While the findings show strong indicators of systematic manipulation, final judgment and legal action should be conducted by competent authorities.

The purpose of this report is to provide structured documentation of suspicious patterns to support informed decision-making by consumers and authorities.
